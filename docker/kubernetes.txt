Basic kubernetes concepts:
    kubectl run --replicas=1000 my-web-server
    kubectl scale --replicas=2000 my-web-server

    can upgrade 2k instances of the app in a rolling-update 
    kubectl rolling-update my-web-server --image=web-server:2 
    kubectl rolling-update my-web-server --rollback

    -> can help u test new feats of ur app (by only uploading a percentage of these instances through A/B testing methods)

    -> support many different networks and storage vendors.
    -> supprot authentication, authorization mechanism

    use Docker host to host applications in the form of Docker containers.

Architecture
    Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes
    A node 
        is a machine physical or virtual on which a kubernetes software set of tools are installed.
        is a worker machine 
            where containers will be launched by kubernetes
    Cluster:
        set of nodes grouped together.
            -> if one node fails -> app still accessible
        Master:
            is a node with kubernetes control plane components installed.
            -> watch over nodes in cluster
                -> responsible for the orchestration of containers on the worker node.

When install kubernetes on a system:
    -> installing the following components :
        -> API server : act as the front end for kubernetes.
            -> user mangement devices , cli all take to the api server
            -> interact with kubernets cluster
        -> etcd service : distributed reliable key value store  
            -> store all data used to manage the cluster
        -> kubelet service : is the agent that run on each node in the cluster.
            -> making sure the container are runing on the node as expected

        -> container runtime : use to run containers (happens to be docker)

        -> controller : the brain behind orchestration
            -> noticing and responding when nodes containers or endpoints goes down.
            -> make decisions to bring up new containers.
        -> scheduler : responsible of distributing work or containers across mutiple nodes 
            -> looks for newly created containers -> assign them to nodes
        
kubectl 
    is the kubernetes CLA
        -> used to deploy and manage applications on a kubernetes cluster -> get kubernets cluster related information 
            -> get the status of the nodes in the cluster
    use to deploy application on the cluster

    kubectl run hello-minikube
    kubectl cluster-info

    kubectl get nodes : list all nodes part of the cluster.

    kubectl run my-web-app --image=my-web-app --replicas=200
