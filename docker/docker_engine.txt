When install Docker on linux host
    -> actually installing 3 components : Docker deamon, rest api, Docker CLI
    
    Docker deamon : background process manages Docker objects : images, containers, volumes, networks.

    REST API server : API interface that programs can use to talk to the deamon and provide instruction 
        -> could create your own tool using this.
    
    Docker CLI : command line interface use to perform actions. 

if docker engine : rest api, docker deamon
laptop : docker cli -> command : docker -H=remote-docker-engine:2375
    ->to run nginx : docker -H=10.123.2.1:2375 run nginx

CONTAINERIZATION

Namespace - PID 

process create in container = process running in docker host
pid in a container are specified by process id created by namespace

cgroups - control groups

Underlying host and containers share the same system resources such as cpu, mem.
    -> how much resources dedicated to the host, containers ?
    -> how does docker manage and share the resources between the containers?

    by default, there is no restriction to how much resource the containers can use.
    -> but we can restrict it

    -> use cgroups to restrict the amount of hardware resources allocated to each container.

    command : docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu 
        -> not take up more than 50% of the host CPU.
        docker run --memory=100m ubuntu 
        -> limit mem can use to 100mb.
