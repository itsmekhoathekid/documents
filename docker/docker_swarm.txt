docker Swarm
    combine mutiple docker machines together into a single cluster
    -> take care of distributing ur services / application instances in to seperate hosts
        -> high availability, load balanceing across different systems and hardware.

Setup Swarm - aka swarm cluster
    must first have :
        host for mutiple hosts with docker installed on them.
        designate one host to be the manager / master / swarm manager, others as slaves or workers.
        run "docker swarm init" on the swarm manager
        on worker nodes : run "docker swarm join --token <token>

DOCKER SERVICE 
    : are one or more instances of a single application or service that runs across the nodes in the swarm clusters.


docker run my-web-server

create a docker serivce to run mutiple instances of my web server application across worker nodes in swarm cluste
    -> on the manager node, run : "docker service create --replicas=3 my-web-server"
    ex : docker service create --replicas=3 -p 8080:80 my-web-server
    ex : docker service create --replicas=3 --network frontend my-web-server
